* On the **Storage Settings** tab, enable the **Collect Logs on Volumes** feature, mount a persistent volume or temporary volume in read-write mode for the container, and set the **Container Log Path**.

* Configure the application in the container to export logs to the **Container Log Path** under the volume mount directory.
