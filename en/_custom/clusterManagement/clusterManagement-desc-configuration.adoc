This section describes how to manage configuration resources.

KubeSphere supports managing the following three types of configuration resources:

* Secret: Contains Base64 encoded key-value pairs, used for storing sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and keys.

* ConfigMap: Contains plain text key-value pairs, used for storing ordinary configuration data.

* Service Account: Stores the access information for the current KubeSphere cluster, used to provide KubeSphere cluster access permissions to applications.
