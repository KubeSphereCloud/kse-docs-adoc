This section describes how to manage app repositories in a workspace.

In the KubeSphere platform, an app specifically refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. The app repository functionality in the KubeSphere platform is implemented based on Helm, defining the orchestration of applications through Helm Charts.

You can add a Helm Chart repository as an app repository to a workspace, thereby enabling the installation of applications from that repository within the projects of the workspace. For information on how to create a Helm Chart repository, please refer to the link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/[Helm official documentation].
