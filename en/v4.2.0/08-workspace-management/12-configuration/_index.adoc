This section describes how to manage configuration resources.

KubeSphere supports managing the following configuration resources:

* **Secrets**: Contains Base64-encoded key-value pairs, used to store confidential data such as passwords, tokens, and keys.

* **ConfigMaps**: Contains plaintext key-value pairs, used to store general configuration data.

// * **Service Accounts**: Stores the access information for the current KubeSphere cluster, used to provide applications with access permissions to the KubeSphere cluster.
