:ks_navigation: **Network > HTTP Traffic**

This section describes how to view detailed records of HTTP requests within the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You need to have the **platform-admin** role on the KubeSphere platform. For more information, refer to link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

* The **WizTelemetry Network Observability** extension needs to be installed and enabled on the KubeSphere platform.

== Steps

include::../../../../../_custom/WizTelemetry/enter-into-WizTelemetry.adoc[]

+

include::../../../../../../_ks_components/oper-navigate.adoc[]

. On the page, use the dropdown menus at the top to select the cluster and project (the project where the traffic flows into) to view the HTTP traffic logs for the selected project within the specified time range.
