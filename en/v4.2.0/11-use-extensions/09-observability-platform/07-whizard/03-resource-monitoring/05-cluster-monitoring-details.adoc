:ks_navigation: **Global Monitoring > Clusters**

This section describes how to view the monitoring details of a single cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You need to have the **platform-admin** role on the KubeSphere platform. For more information, refer to link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

* The host cluster and the member clusters to be monitored need to have WizTelemetry Global Monitoring enabled.

// Note
include::../../../../../../_ks_components/admonitions/note.adoc[]

If a member cluster does not have WizTelemetry Global Monitoring enabled, WizTelemetry Global Monitoring will not be able to retrieve data from that member cluster.
