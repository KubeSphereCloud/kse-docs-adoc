This section introduces how to use the KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension.

The KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension provides microservices, microservice configuration, and microservice gateway functionalities. The microservice registration and configuration features are based on link:https://nacos.io[Nacos], and the microservice gateway is based on Spring Cloud Gateway. If your existing applications comply with the Nacos specification, the KubeSphere Spring Cloud feature can help you maintain your original framework while gaining the operational efficiency of containerized applications.

After installing the KubeSphere Spring Cloud extension, the **Spring Cloud** menu will appear in the workspace's left navigation pane. On the **Microservices** page, you must **Enable Spring Cloud** for a project before you can use the microservices, microservice configuration, and microservice gateway features.
