This section describes how to delete a pod.

// Note
include::../../../../_ks_components/admonitions/note.adoc[]

* It is recommended to delete a pod by deleting its managing resource (such as a workload or Job), rather than deleting the pod directly.

* If you delete a pod directly, depending on the policy of the pod's managing resource, the system may recreate the pod.

// Warning
include::../../../../_ks_components/admonitions/warning.adoc[]

Deleting a running pod may cause business interruption. Please perform this operation with caution.
