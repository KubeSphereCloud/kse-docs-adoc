:ks_permission: **Persistent Volume Claim Management**
:ks_navigation: **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims**


Persistent Volumes (PVs) are the core carriers of cluster storage resources. In addition to being dynamically created through Persistent Volume Claims, they can also be created manually.


== Prerequisites


:relfileprefix: ../../../../

include::../../../../_custom/clusterManagement/clusterManagement-prer-requiredPermission_new.adoc[]

:relfileprefix: ./



== Steps

+
include::../../../../_custom/clusterManagement/persistentVolumes/persistentVolumes-oper-openListPage.adoc[]

+

include::../../../../../_ks_components/oper-clickCreate.adoc[]

+

. On the **Basic Information** tab, set the basic information for the persistent volume, then click **Next**.
