The gateway provides reverse proxy for services on the KubeSphere platform. The gateway works based on Ingress. Business traffic from clients is first sent to the gateway via domain name resolution, and then the gateway forwards the business traffic to different services according to the rules defined in the Ingress. The gateway itself is also a workload exposed through a service, thus the gateway also supports two external access modes: NodePort and LoadBalancer.
