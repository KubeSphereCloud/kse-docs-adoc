For more information, please refer to link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Kubernetes official documentation].

* **Bound**: The Persistent Volume is already bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim.

* **Released**: The PersistentVolumeClaim bound to the Persistent Volume has been deleted, but the Persistent Volume itself has not been deleted.

* **Failed**: The Persistent Volume has an unknown error.
