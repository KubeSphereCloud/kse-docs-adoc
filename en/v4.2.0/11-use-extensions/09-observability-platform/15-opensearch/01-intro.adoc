The OpenSearch service provided by the "OpenSearch Distributed Search and Analytics Engine" extension serves as the default log receiver for KubeSphere, used for storing observability data such as logs, audits, events, and notification history.

In addition to supporting the deployment of OpenSearch, this extension also supports the deployment of OpenSearch Dashboard and OpenSearch Curator.

* **OpenSearch Dashboard** is a user interface for visualizing OpenSearch data and managing the OpenSearch cluster. It is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `opensearch-dashboards.enabled` field to true.

* **OpenSearch Curator** is a CronJob that periodically cleans up Kubernetes event logs, Kubernetes audit logs, Kubernetes application logs, and notification history logs older than the configured number of days (default is 7 days). It is enabled by default. To disable it, set the `opensearch-curator.enabled` field to false.
