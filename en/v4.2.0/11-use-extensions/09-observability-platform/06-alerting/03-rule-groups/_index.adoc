This section describes how to create, edit, enable, disable, and view alert rule groups in clusters and projects.

After a rule group is created, the system can generate alerts when specific monitoring metrics meet preset conditions and durations.

|
- KubeSphere provides built-in rule groups for clusters and also supports custom rule groups. If the WizTelemetry Global Monitoring extension is installed, built-in rule groups can only be managed in the global alerting of the WizTelemetry Observability Platform. For more information, refer to link:../../07-whizard/05-alert-management/01-rule-groups/[Global Alerting].

- In projects, only custom rule groups are supported.
