This section describes how to use the "WizTelemetry Global Monitoring" extension.

WizTelemetry Global Monitoring is an extension within the WizTelemetry Observability Platform that provides cross-cluster resource monitoring and multi-cluster alerting, incorporating the functionalities of the original Whizard Observability Center. You can view aggregated monitoring data from all clusters and detailed monitoring data for each individual cluster within the WizTelemetry Observability Platform. Additionally, you can create global alert rule groups at the platform level and view system-generated global alerts.

After installing the "WizTelemetry Global Monitoring" extension, the **Global Monitoring** and **Global Alerting** menus will appear in the WizTelemetry Observability Platform within the Component Dock.
