|Code Repository Branch
|The branch of the source code repository.

|Code Repository Secret
|If your code repository requires authentication, select the Secret containing the code repository credentials.

|Image Name
|The name of the target container image to be built. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), forward slashes (/), and colons (:), and must start and end with a lowercase letter or number.

The image name should include the image namespace, for example, **<DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/<IMAGE NAME>**. If no namespace is entered, the system will automatically add the namespace **library**, resulting in an actual image name of **library/<IMAGE NAME>**.

|Image Tag
|The tag of the target container image to be built.

|Target Image Service
|The image service used to store the target image. Select the Secret containing the image service information.

|Trigger Token
|The authentication token used by a client to trigger a KubeSphere image build via webhook. If a token is set, requests must provide the correct token to trigger the image build. The token can only contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.

After the service is created, KubeSphere will create an image builder and provide a URL that can be used by third-party applications to trigger the image build. You can obtain the URL on the details page of the image builder.
