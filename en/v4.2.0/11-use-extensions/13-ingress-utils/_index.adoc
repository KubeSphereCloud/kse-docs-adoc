This section introduces how to use the "KubeSphere Application Routing Tool" extension. After installation, only the KubeSphere platform administrator and the administrators of the cluster where the extension is installed can use this extension.

The "KubeSphere Application Routing Tool" provides several practical extension capabilities for Ingress, such as domain name reuse validation, aiming to enhance the global management capabilities of Ingress. After adding domain names that need to be restricted from reuse, users will not be able to use the same domain name in Ingress under different gateways, to avoid mutual interference between Ingress and prevent errors in production business.

Before installing the "KubeSphere Application Routing Tool" extension, you must first install the "KubeSphere Gateway" extension.

After installing the "KubeSphere Application Routing Tool" extension, the **Application Routing Tool** option will be displayed under the **Application Workloads** menu in the left navigation pane of the cluster.
