This section introduces how to manage Custom Resource Definitions.

Custom Resource Definitions are used to extend the existing Kubernetes API. You can use Custom Resource Definitions to create custom resources and implement custom business logic by using additional controllers to listen for various events of the custom resources.

The KubeSphere web console currently only supports viewing Custom Resource Definitions and custom resources, as well as editing existing custom resources. It does not support directly creating Custom Resource Definitions and custom resources. You can refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Kubernetes official documentation] to create Custom Resource Definitions and custom resources via the command line.
