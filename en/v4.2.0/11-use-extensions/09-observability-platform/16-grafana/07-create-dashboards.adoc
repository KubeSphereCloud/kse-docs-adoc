After adding a data source, create a Dashboard to visualize the data from the data source.

A Dashboard consists of one or more Panels, organized and arranged in rows. Panels display visualizations and provide various control options.

This section briefly introduces how to create a Dashboard. For more information, please refer to link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/[Grafana dashboards].

== Steps

. In the Grafana console, click **Dashboards** in the left navigation pane.
. Click **New > New Dashboard**.
. On the blank Dashboard page, click **+ Add visualization**.
. In the pop-up dialog box, select the added data source. The Panel editing page will open automatically.

.. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/refresh-light.png[refresh-light,18,18] to query the data.

.. Click the chart type (e.g., Time series) on the right to select a chart style. The data will be displayed in that style.

.. In the **Panel options** area, set the Panel name, description, etc.

.. After editing, click **Apply** to save the Panel, and click **Save** to save the Dashboard.

When saving the Dashboard, you can set the Dashboard name, description, and the folder it belongs to.

. On the newly created Dashboard page, click **Add** at the top, select **Visualization** to continue adding Panels.

. After exiting the Panel editing page, you can drag the Panel title to move it to any position; drag the mouse at the bottom right corner of the Panel to adjust the size of the Panel in the Dashboard.

. Click the save button at the top of the Dashboard page to save the Dashboard again.

At this point, a Dashboard containing multiple Panels is created.
