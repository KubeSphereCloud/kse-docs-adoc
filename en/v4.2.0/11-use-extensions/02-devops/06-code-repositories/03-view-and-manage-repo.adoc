This section describes how to view code repository details and modify files within a repository.


== Prerequisites

* The **DevOps** extension must be installed and enabled on the KubeSphere platform.

* A workspace, a DevOps project, and a user (e.g., **project-regular**) have been created. The user has been invited to the DevOps project and granted the **operator** role. Refer to link:../../02-devops-project-mangement/03-project-members/01-invite-a-user-to-a-project/[Invite a User to a DevOps Project].
