. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg["more",18,18] on the right side of the node you want to operate on, then select **Stop Scheduling** from the drop-down list. After the operation is complete, the node status will change to **Unschedulable**.

. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg["more",18,18] on the right side of a node with the status **Unschedulable**, then select **Enable Scheduling** from the drop-down list to allow pods to be scheduled to this node.

// Note
include::../../../../_ks_components/admonitions/note.adoc[]

After a node's status is set to **Unschedulable**, newly created pods will no longer be scheduled to this node. The pods originally running on the node are not affected.
