This section introduces how to use the "KubeSphere App Store Management" extension.

After installing the "KubeSphere App Store Management" extension, the **App Templates** option will appear under the **Application Management** menu in the workspace's left navigation pane, and the **App Store Management** option will appear in the **Component Dock** in the upper right corner of the page.

Using this extension:

- Workspace administrators can manage application templates and submit applications defined in the templates to the App Store. Once approved and listed by the App Store administrator, the applications can be published to the App Store, making them available for installation by all projects on the KubeSphere platform.

- App Store administrators can perform operations such as categorizing, reviewing, listing, and delisting application templates in the App Store, manage the platform's application repositories and all deployed application instances, and directly deploy applications to projects.
