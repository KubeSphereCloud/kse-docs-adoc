|The KubeSphere Community Edition only allows the creation of project gateways. It does not support the creation of cluster gateways or workspace gateways.

KubeSphere provides a cluster gateway for each cluster, a workspace gateway for each workspace within a cluster, and a project gateway for each project within a workspace. These are used to provide reverse proxy for services across the entire cluster, within a single workspace, and within a single project, respectively.

Cluster gateways, workspace gateways, and project gateways are independent of each other, allowing you to freely enable any one of them.

After installing the "KubeSphere Gateway" extension,

* The **Gateway Settings** option will appear under the **Cluster Settings** menu in the cluster's left navigation pane, allowing you to enable the cluster gateway.
* The **Gateway Settings** option will appear under the **Workspace Settings** menu in the workspace's left navigation pane, allowing you to enable workspace gateways and project gateways.

|Tip

|
After enabling a cluster gateway, workspace gateway, or project gateway, when you create an Ingress under the **Application Workloads > Ingress** menu of a cluster or workspace, you can select the corresponding gateway's IngressClassName on the **Routing Rule** tab.
// It has been confirmed that this is optional.
