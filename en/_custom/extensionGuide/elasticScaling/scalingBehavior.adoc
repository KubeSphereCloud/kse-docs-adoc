|Parameter |Description

|Policy Preference
|When multiple policies exist under the scaling up/down policy, the scaler will select the final value from the calculation results of these policies based on the policy preference.

* Prefer large-scale scaling: Execute scaling according to the policy with the largest change in replica count.

* Prefer small-scale scaling: Execute scaling according to the policy with the smallest change in replica count.

* Disable scaling: Disable scaling in that direction.

|Stabilization Window
|The scaler will collect all suggested replica counts within the set time window and select a final value based on rules to prevent frequent changes in replica count caused by short-term metric fluctuations.

// When scaling down, KEDA selects the maximum value from all suggested replica counts; when scaling up, KEDA selects the minimum value. This rule only applies to the selection of replica counts within the stabilization window.

|Policy Type
|The basis for scaling calculation.

* Percentage: Scale based on a percentage of the current replica count.
* Pod: Scale by a fixed number of pods.

|Scaling Up/Down Value
|The maximum allowable change per scaling operation under the current policy.

|Activation Time
|The minimum time window during which the associated metric rule must be continuously satisfied before the policy takes effect. Unit: seconds.
