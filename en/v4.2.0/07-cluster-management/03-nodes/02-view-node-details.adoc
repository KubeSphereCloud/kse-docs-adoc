|Area |Description

|Health Status
|Displays the node's network, memory, disk, process pressure, and readiness status. If image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/check-healthy.svg["healthy",15px,15px] is displayed, the status is normal. If image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/substract-unhealthy.svg["unhealthy",15px,15px] is displayed, an alert has been triggered.

* **Network Availability**: Whether the node's network configuration is correct.

* **Memory Pressure**: Whether the node's remaining memory is less than the threshold. The default threshold is 100 MiB.

* **Disk Pressure**: Whether the node's remaining disk space or number of inodes is less than the threshold. The default disk space threshold is 10% of the total disk space, and the default inode threshold is 5% of the maximum number of inodes.

* **Process Pressure**: Whether the number of processes that can be created on the node is less than the threshold. Newly installed KubeSphere clusters do not have a process count threshold set by default.

* **Readiness Status**: Whether the node is ready to receive pods.

|Taints
|The taints currently configured on this node. For more information, please refer to link:../05-edit-node-taints/[Edit Node Taints].
