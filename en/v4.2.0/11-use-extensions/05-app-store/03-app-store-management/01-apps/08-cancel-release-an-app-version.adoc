This section describes how to unpublish an app version.

After an app template is listed, if you unpublish an app version within it, that version will be removed from the App Store. If all app versions within an app template are in the **Unpublished** state, the app template will be automatically delisted.

After an app version is unpublished, App Store administrators and workspace members can delete that app version.
