In the KubeSphere platform, an application specifically refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. Based on the method of creation, applications on the KubeSphere platform are categorized into the following two types:

*   Template-based applications: Applications created using existing application templates. The application templates used for creation can be those uploaded to a workspace, those already published to the App Store, or those from third-party application repositories.

*   Composed apps: Applications created by users manually orchestrating workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. When creating a composed app, you can enable application governance to utilize the traffic monitoring, canary release, and link tracing features provided by KubeSphere.
