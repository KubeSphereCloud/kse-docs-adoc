This section introduces how to use the "WizTelemetry Tracing" extension.

WizTelemetry Tracing provides distributed tracing functionality based on link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/[OpenTelemetry].

Tracing is a technique for monitoring distributed systems. It identifies each request with a unique Trace ID and records the request's flow path across various services. As a request traverses the system, key operations within each service are recorded as Spans, containing critical information such as duration and status. These Spans form a complete call chain (Trace) through parent-child relationships, allowing you to clearly observe the full request flow through visualization tools and quickly locate delays, errors, or performance bottlenecks. For more information, please refer to the link:https://opentelemetry.io/zh/docs/concepts/signals/traces/[OpenTelemetry official documentation].

After installing the "WizTelemetry Tracing" extension, the **Tracing** menu will appear in the WizTelemetry Observability Platform within the Component Dock.
