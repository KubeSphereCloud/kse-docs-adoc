This section introduces how to manage workload templates.

Workload templates are core tools in cloud-native environments used to simplify application deployment and management. Their main functions include:

- **Standardized Configuration**: By predefining parameters such as resource requirements (e.g., CPU, memory), replica count, and health checks, they ensure consistent configuration for each deployment, reducing human error.
- **Rapid Replication**: Support quick replication and scaling, allowing for batch creation of workload instances or dynamic scaling to handle traffic changes.
- **Multi-Environment Adaptation**: Through parameterized configuration, the same template can be adapted to different environments such as development, testing, and production without repeated modifications.
// - **Automated Operations**: Combined with CI/CD tools, they enable automated deployment and updates from templates to actual workloads, improving operational efficiency.

In short, workload templates significantly enhance application deployment efficiency, reliability, and scalability through standardization, flexibility, and automation.
