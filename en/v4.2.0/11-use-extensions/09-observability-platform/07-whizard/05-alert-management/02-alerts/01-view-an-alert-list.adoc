This section describes how to view the global alert list.

The Built-in Alerts and Custom Alerts pages under Global Alerts display alerts generated by the system based on global alert rule groups, and do not include alerts generated by the system based on cluster and project alert rule groups.

== Prerequisites

You need to have the **platform-admin** role in the KubeSphere platform. For more information, refer to link:../../../../../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../../../../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].
