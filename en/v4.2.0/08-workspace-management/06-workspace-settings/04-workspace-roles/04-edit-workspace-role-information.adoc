This section describes how to edit workspace role information.

You can edit the alias and description of a workspace role created by a user. KubeSphere does not support editing built-in workspace roles, nor does it support editing the name of a workspace role.

== Prerequisites

:relfileprefix: ../../../../

include::../../../../_custom/workspaceManagement/workspaceManagement-prer-requiredPermission_v4.adoc[]

:relfileprefix: ./

== Steps

include::../../../../_custom/workspaceManagement/workspaceManagement-oper-openWorkspacePage.adoc[]

+

include::../../../../../_ks_components/oper-navigate.adoc[]

+

. To the right of the workspace role you want to operate, click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg[more,18,18], and then select **Edit Information** from the drop-down list.

. In the **Edit Information** dialog box, set the alias and description for the workspace role, and then click **OK**.
