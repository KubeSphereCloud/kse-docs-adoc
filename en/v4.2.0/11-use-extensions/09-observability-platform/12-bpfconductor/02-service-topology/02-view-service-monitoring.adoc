This section describes how to observe the performance of services within a cluster in real-time.

== Prerequisites

* You need to have the **platform-admin** role in the KubeSphere platform. For more information, refer to link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../../../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

* The **WizTelemetry Network Observability** extension needs to be installed and enabled on the KubeSphere platform.

== Steps
