After upgrading from KubeSphere v4.1.2 to v4.1.3, the version of `redis-operator` has changed. The new version no longer manages Redis Cluster instances created by the old version of redis-operator.

In the database management platform, you can still view the existing Redis Cluster instances, but you cannot perform operations such as scaling or adding/removing nodes through the web console. The new version of redis-operator will also not maintain the state of the old Redis Cluster instances.

== Recommendations

. Back up the data of the old Redis Cluster.

. Recreate a Redis Cluster to replace the old one.
