This section describes how to manage Jobs.

On the KubeSphere platform, applications run in pods. Jobs are used to manage pods that run only once or periodically. The KubeSphere platform supports the following types of Jobs:

* Job: Used to manage pods that run only once. If a pod fails, the system will restart the pod according to the policy set in the Job until specific conditions are met.

* CronJob: Used to manage pods that run periodically. The system creates and runs Jobs according to the schedule set in the CronJob. Each time a pod runs, if it fails, the CronJob will restart the pod according to the user-set policy until specific conditions are met.
