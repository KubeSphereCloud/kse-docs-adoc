This section describes how to use the Route Tool to add domains, so that domain uniqueness validation can be performed when creating or editing an Ingress. For more information about Ingress, refer to the "Ingress" chapter in the *KubeSphere Workspace and Project Management Guide*.
endif::[]

Validation Rule: Ingresses under the same gateway can use the same domain and its subdomains. Ingresses under different gateways cannot use the same domain.

// The following operations on the KubeSphere platform support domain uniqueness validation:

// * Cluster > Application Workloads > Ingress > Create/Edit routing rule
// * Project > Application Workloads > Ingress > Create/Edit routing rule
// * Project > Service Mesh > composed app > Add Ingress > Create/Edit routing rule
// * Federated Project > Application Workloads > Ingress > Create/Edit routing rule
// * Federated Project > Application Workloads > composed app > Create composed app > Create/Edit routing rule
