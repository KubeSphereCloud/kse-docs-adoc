This section introduces how to manage workloads.

In the KubeSphere platform, applications run in pods. To ensure business continuity when a single pod fails, it is usually necessary to create multiple replicas of an application. A workload is a resource used to manage pod replicas, responsible for managing multiple replicas of an application, and mainly provides the following functions:

* Monitor pod status, automatically restart or replace unhealthy pods.
* Allocate and limit resources such as CPU and memory for pods.
* Automatically update pods according to the update strategy specified by the user.
* Roll back pods to a previous version.

Federated projects support the following workload types:

* Deployment: Used to manage stateless applications. Multiple pod replicas managed by a Deployment share a single volume. When a pod replica is recreated, the name of the new pod replica is different from the old one.

* StatefulSet: Used to manage stateful applications. Multiple pod replicas managed by a StatefulSet can use independent volumes respectively. Each pod replica has a fixed ordinal name. When a pod replica is recreated, the new pod replica has the same name as the old one.

// * DaemonSet: Used to manage daemon processes. A DaemonSet ensures that all or specific nodes run a pod replica. When a new node is added to the cluster, if the new node meets the pod scheduling rules, the DaemonSet will automatically create a pod replica on the new node.
