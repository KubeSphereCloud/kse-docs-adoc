This section introduces how to manage storage resources.

KubeSphere supports managing the following storage resources in a project:

* Persistent Volume Claim: Defines storage space requirements. Based on the parameters in the Persistent Volume Claim, the system creates a storage area in the backend storage system that can be used by containers. Each storage area corresponds to a Persistent Volume on the KubeSphere platform.

// * Volume Snapshot: Defines the storage requirements for snapshot data. Based on the parameters in the Volume Snapshot, the system saves the snapshot data in the backend storage system.
