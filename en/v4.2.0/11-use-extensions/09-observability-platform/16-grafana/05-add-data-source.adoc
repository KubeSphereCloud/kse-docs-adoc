This section briefly describes how to add, configure, and query data sources. For more information, please refer to link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/[Grafana data sources].

Before creating a Dashboard, you must first add a data source. The Grafana for WizTelemetry extension automatically adds the Prometheus server address as a data source by default. You can also add your own data sources, such as Loki, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

After adding a data source, you can:

- Query data using Explore.
- Visualize data in panels.
- Create alerting rules.

== Prerequisites

Only users with the admin role in the Grafana console can add or delete data sources.

== Add a Data Source

. After logging into the Grafana console, click **Connections** in the left navigation pane.
. Search for a data source, such as **loki**.
. Click the data source name to enter the data source overview page.
. Click **Add new data source** in the upper right corner to enter the data source configuration page.
. Enter the server address of the data source and click **Save & test** at the bottom to complete the addition and configuration of the data source.

== Query Data Source Data

Set query conditions to retrieve data for specific metrics within a time range from the data source.

. Click **Explore** in the left navigation pane and select the data source at the top.
. In the query editor, enter or select a **Metric**, set **Label filters**, and then click **Run query** in the upper right corner.
