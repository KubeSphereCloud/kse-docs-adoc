During the installation check, the system will identify if the extension has any dependencies. Dependencies are divided into required extensions and optional extensions.

If the status of a required extension is **Not Ready**, you need to install the correct version of the required extension first to ensure the normal use of the extension. Optional extensions will not affect the installation of the extension.
