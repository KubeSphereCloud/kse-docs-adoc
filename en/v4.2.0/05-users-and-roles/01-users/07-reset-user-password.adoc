This section describes how to reset a user password.

If a regular user forgets their password and cannot log in to the KubeSphere web console, please refer to link:../06-change-the-password-of-a-user[this document] to have an administrator change the user's password.

If a platform administrator forgets their password, execute the following command on the host cluster to modify the password for the specified account.

[,bash]
----
kubectl patch users <USERNAME> -p '{"spec":{"password":"<YOURPASSWORD>"}}' --type='merge' && kubectl annotate users <USERNAME> iam.kubesphere.io/password-encrypted-
----

Replace `<USERNAME>` in the command with the actual username, and `<YOURPASSWORD>` with the actual new password.

The new password `<YOURPASSWORD>` must meet the password requirements. The password must contain at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one special character (~!@#$%^&*()-_=+\|[{}];:'",<.>/? or space), and be 8 to 64 characters in length.

Example:

[,bash]

kubectl patch users admin -p '{"spec":{"password":"P@88w0rd"}}' --type='merge' && kubectl annotate users admin iam.kubesphere.io/password-encrypted-
