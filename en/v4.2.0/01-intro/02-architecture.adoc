KubeSphere LuBan is a distributed, cloud-native, extensible, and open architecture that provides a hot-pluggable microkernel for extension components. The core part (KubeSphere Core) only includes essential basic functions required for system operation, while independent business modules are encapsulated in various extension components (Extensions). Users can dynamically install, uninstall, enable, or disable extension components while the system is running.

== KubeSphere LuBan Architecture

The architectural design of KubeSphere LuBan is shown in the following diagram.

== Why KubeSphere LuBan Was Introduced

Since 2018, the KubeSphere hybrid multi-cloud container management platform has released over a dozen versions, including three major releases. To meet user demands, KubeSphere has integrated numerous enterprise-grade features, such as multi-tenant management, multi-cluster management, DevOps, GitOps, service mesh, microservices, observability (including monitoring, alerting, logging, auditing, events, notifications, etc.), application store, edge computing, and network and storage management.

Although KubeSphere's all-in-one container solution greatly enhances the user experience with containers, it also presents the following challenges:

**Long Release Cycles**

When releasing a new version, it is necessary to wait for all components to complete development, testing, and pass integration testing.

**Delayed Response to Users**

Since components cannot be iterated independently, after a KubeSphere release, feedback from the community and users regarding components must wait for a new KubeSphere version to be released before being delivered, resulting in insufficiently timely responses.

**Code Coupling**

Although it was previously possible to individually enable/disable specific components, the frontend and backend code of these components were still coupled together, making them prone to mutual interference and architecturally inelegant.

**Excessive System Resource Consumption**

Some components are enabled by default, which may consume excessive system resources for users without related requirements.

== Advantages of KubeSphere LuBan

**Plugin-Based Core Framework**

Supports independent development and deployment of components to extend system functionality. Components can be added, upgraded, or removed as needed without modifying the core framework's code.

**Fully Open Basic UI Component Library**

Components are open to everyone; anyone can freely access, use, and extend these components. Users can customize and extend them according to their needs to meet different design and functional requirements.

**Hot Updates and Hot Fixes for Frontend and Backend**

Developers can perform real-time updates and fixes to the frontend and backend while the system is running, improving development and operational efficiency while ensuring application availability and user experience.

**Open Extension Center, Ecosystem Co-creation**

We provide an open platform that encourages third-party developers to add new features or enhance existing ones through components, develop and integrate within the system's framework, and seamlessly connect their components with the system, collectively building a healthy and prosperous ecosystem.

== How KubeSphere LuBan Can Help You

The KubeSphere LuBan architecture can benefit the following individuals:

**KubeSphere Users**

KubeSphere users can freely choose which KubeSphere extension components to enable. They can also seamlessly integrate their own applications into the KubeSphere console. Additionally, as the KubeSphere extension component ecosystem grows, users can freely select a richer variety of products and services from the KubeSphere Extension Center, ultimately achieving a personalized container management platform.

**KubeSphere Maintainers**

The extension mechanism allows maintainers to focus more on developing KubeSphere's core features, making KubeSphere Core lighter and accelerating version release cycles. Moreover, because extension components can iterate independently, they can more promptly meet user needs.

**KubeSphere Contributors**

The introduction of the extension mechanism makes KubeSphere Core and other KubeSphere extension components more loosely coupled and easier to develop.

**Cloud-Native Application Developers (ISVs) or Other Open-Source Projects**

Numerous ISVs or other open-source projects can seamlessly integrate their products or open-source projects into the KubeSphere ecosystem at low cost. For example, Karmada/KubeEdge developers can develop independent Karmada/KubeEdge consoles based on KubeSphere LuBan.

== What is a KubeSphere Extension Component?

A KubeSphere extension component is a Helm Chart that can extend KubeSphere's functionality, orchestrated via Helm, and adheres to the KubeSphere extension component development specifications.

As a developer in the cloud-native field, you no longer need to spend a significant amount of time learning a proprietary application orchestration method.

Visit link:https://kubesphere.com.cn/extensions/marketplace/[KubeSphere Marketplace] to view and install published extension components.

== What Can KubeSphere Extension Components Do?

From the frontend UI to the backend API, almost every part of KubeSphere can be customized and enhanced through extension APIs. Many of KubeSphere's core features are also built as extensions using the same extension APIs.

Here are some examples of what can be achieved using extension APIs:

. Inject new menus and functional pages into the project's sidebar navigation to support managing more types of resources.
. Inject functional entry points at the platform level menu to enhance platform management capabilities.
. Directly embed existing third-party functional component pages into KubeSphere to aggregate various dispersed systems.
. Override existing page routes in KubeSphere to implement your unique business logic.
. Extend KubeSphere's APIs.
