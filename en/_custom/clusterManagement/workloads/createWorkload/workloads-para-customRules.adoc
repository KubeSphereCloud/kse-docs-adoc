|Parameter |Description

|Type

* **Away from Target**: Pod replicas will be scheduled onto different nodes from pods with specific labels in the current project.

|Strategy

The enforcement strategy of the rule.

* **Prefer Matching**: Try to meet the rule requirements as much as possible. If the rule requirements cannot be met, pod replicas will be scheduled onto nodes that do not meet the requirements.

|Target
|
The target of the rule. Pod replicas will be scheduled onto the same node or different nodes as pods with the **app=**<target> label (<target> is the value selected here), depending on the rule's type and strategy.
