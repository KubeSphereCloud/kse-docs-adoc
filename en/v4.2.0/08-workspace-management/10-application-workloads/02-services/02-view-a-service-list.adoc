|Service Type
|The type of service. Depending on how the service is created, KubeSphere categorizes services as follows:

include::../../../../_custom/clusterManagement/services/services-para-statelessStatefulExternal.adoc[]

* **External Service**: The service forwards business traffic to other services outside the cluster. The system does not assign a virtual IP address to the service. It can be accessed from within the cluster using a domain name in the format <service name>.<project name>**.svc.cluster.local**.

* **Custom Service**: A service created by the user by customizing the internal access mode and backend workloads.

|Application
|The application to which the service belongs.

|Internal Access
