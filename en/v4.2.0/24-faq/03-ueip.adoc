// == What is the Improvement Program?

// The Improvement Program collects aggregated information about KubeSphere installation and feature usage. This information will be used by KubeSphere solely for product improvement and will not be shared with any third parties.

== Purpose and Content

To continuously improve the quality, performance, and user experience of the KubeSphere product, we have established the User Experience Improvement Program (hereinafter referred to as "UEIP"). Participating in the UEIP will help us analyze usage patterns, diagnose issues, and prioritize the development of future product features. The information that may be collected under this program is non-personally identifiable, aggregated data, primarily including:

**Feature Usage**: The frequency and duration of usage for various functional modules.

**Performance Data**: Performance metrics such as page load times and operation response speeds.

**Hardware Configuration**: Operating system type, CPU architecture, memory and disk size, etc. (specific models cannot be identified).

== Privacy Protection Commitment

We solemnly commit to:

**Not Collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: The UEIP will not intentionally collect any information that can identify an individual, such as your name, email address, IP address, server IP, business data, or any other sensitive information.

**Data Anonymization**: All collected data will undergo strict anonymization and aggregation processes, making it impossible to trace back to any specific individual or organization.

**Restriction of Data Use**: This data will be used solely for internal statistical analysis, product improvement, and trend research within the KubeSphere project, and will never be sold to any third party.

== Participation Method and User Control

**Voluntary Participation**: Participation in the UEIP is completely voluntary. When you first install or use this product, the system will explicitly prompt you to choose whether to join.

**Opting Out at Any Time**: You can turn off this feature at any time to opt out of the program and stop data collection. Your choice will not affect the core functionality of this product or the services you enjoy.

== Data Transmission and Security

The collected data will be securely transmitted to our servers through encrypted channels.

We will employ security measures that comply with industry standards to store and process this data.

== User Commitment and Acknowledgment

You have fully understood the above User Experience Improvement Program and agree to allow the platform to anonymously collect cluster performance data to improve services.

== How to Participate in or Opt Out of the Improvement Program?
