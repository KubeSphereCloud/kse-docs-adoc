This section introduces how to manage the App Store.

The App Store provides application templates based on Helm Charts, which are accessible to all members of projects on the KubeSphere platform.

App Store administrators can categorize, review, publish, unpublish, and perform other operations on application templates in the App Store. They can also manage the platform's application repositories and all deployed application instances, and directly deploy applications to projects.

After installing the "KubeSphere App Store Management" extension, click the image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/grid.svg[grid,18,18] icon in the upper right corner of the page, select **App Store Management**, and enter the App Store management page.
