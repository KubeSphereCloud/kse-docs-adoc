This section introduces how to use the alerting feature.

Alerts are generated by the system based on alert rule groups. When the metrics set in an alert rule group meet the preset conditions and duration, the system generates an alert. When the metrics no longer meet the preset conditions, the alert is automatically cleared by the system.
