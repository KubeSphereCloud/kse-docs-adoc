|Parameter |Description

| CRD Name
| The CRD name corresponding to the constraint template.

|Targets
| Targets are the target objects of the constraint, i.e., the resource objects to which the constraint rules need to be applied. Targets can be various resources in the Kubernetes cluster, such as pods, Deployments, Namespaces, etc. The constraint will be applied to these target objects to ensure they meet the requirements of the constraint rules.
