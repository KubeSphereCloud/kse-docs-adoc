During the installation check, the system will identify if the extension has any dependencies. Dependencies are divided into required extensions and optional extensions.

If the status of a required extension is **Not Ready**, you need to install the correct version of the required extension first to ensure the normal use of the extension. Optional extensions do not affect the installation of the extension.

. On the **Extension Installation** tab, modify the configuration of the extension (optional), then click **Start Installation** to begin installing the extension.
