This section introduces how to use the "WizTelemetry Monitoring" extension.

WizTelemetry Monitoring is an extension within the WizTelemetry Observability Platform that provides monitoring capabilities. It offers multi-tenant, cloud-native resource monitoring, including real-time and historical data display of core monitoring metrics for objects such as multi-clusters, nodes, workloads, GPUs, and the K8s control plane.
