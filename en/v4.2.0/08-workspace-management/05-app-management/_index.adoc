// This section introduces how to manage application repositories.

// In the KubeSphere platform, an application specifically refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. The application template and application repository features of the KubeSphere platform are implemented based on Helm, defining the orchestration method of applications through Helm Charts.

// You can create an application template containing one or more application versions (each application version is defined by a Helm Chart) in a workspace, thereby installing the applications defined in the application template into the projects within the workspace. You can also add a Helm Chart repository as an application repository to the workspace, thereby installing the applications from the application repository into the projects within the workspace.

// For more information about Helm, please refer to link:https://helm.sh/zh/docs/[Helm Official Documentation].
