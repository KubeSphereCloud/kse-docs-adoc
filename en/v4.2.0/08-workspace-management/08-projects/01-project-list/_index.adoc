This section introduces how to manage ordinary projects in a workspace. All resources in an ordinary project run on the same cluster.

On the KubeSphere platform, both workspaces and projects are used for grouping and managing resources. Each workspace can contain multiple projects.


// KubeSphere supports two types of projects:

// * Ordinary Projects: Projects created based on a single cluster. All resources in an ordinary project run on the same cluster.

// * Federated Projects: Projects created based on multiple clusters. Resources in a federated project can run on different clusters.
