|Parameter |Description

|Protocol
|The actual protocol listened to by the application in the target container.

|Name

|Parameter |Description

|NodePort
|The system maps a node's port to the service port, allowing the service to be accessed via the node's IP address and the node port.

|LoadBalancer
|Based on a NodePort service, the system assigns an external IP address to the service and binds it to an external load balancer. The external load balancer listens on the node port corresponding to the service, enabling access to the service via the external IP address. To achieve this, a LoadBalancer type service requires support from a load balancer plugin and the infrastructure environment, and relevant annotations need to be set. For more information, please contact your infrastructure environment provider.
