This section introduces how to manage volume snapshot classes.

A volume snapshot class defines a type of volume snapshot available for containers. Before creating a volume snapshot class, install a storage plugin for the KubeSphere cluster and ensure the backend storage system supports the volume snapshot feature. For more information, contact your storage system provider.
