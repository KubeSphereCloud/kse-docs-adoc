This section describes how to manage pods.

In KubeSphere, a pod is the smallest manageable unit of an application. Each pod contains one or more containers. Multiple containers within the same pod are tightly coupled, scheduled together, and share the network. A pod is equivalent to the logical host of an application.

The KubeSphere web console does not support creating pods individually. You can create pods indirectly by creating application workloads or Jobs, and manage multiple pod replicas.
