* To monitor the metrics of an application, you need to configure the application running in the container to expose monitoring metrics that comply with the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/[Prometheus specification] at a certain server-side path. You also need to set up a metrics exporter on the service used to expose the workload to declare the path that provides the application monitoring metrics. For more information, see xref:11-use-extensions/09-observability-platform/05-monitoring/08-edit-a-metrics-exporter.adoc[Edit a Metrics Exporter].
