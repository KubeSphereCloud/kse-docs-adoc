|Parameter |Description

|Constraint Name
|The name of the constraint.

|Constraint Type
|The constraint template used by the constraint.

|enforcementAction
|The `enforcementAction` field defines the action to take for constraint violations. It is set to `deny` by default, meaning any admission request that violates the constraint is denied by default. For more information, refer to link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/violations/[Constraint Violation Handling].

|Match Kinds
|The `match` field defines the resources to which the constraint applies. For more information, refer to link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#the-match-field[match].

`kinds` accepts a list of objects containing `apiGroups` and `kinds` fields, which list the groups/kinds of objects the constraint applies to. If multiple groups/kinds objects are specified, a resource is in scope for the constraint if it matches any one of those objects.

|Namespace Labels
|Identifiable key-value pairs set for the namespace where the object resides or for the object itself if the object is a namespace.

|Parameters
|Used to describe the intent of the constraint. For more information, refer to link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#the-parameters-field[parameters].

You can view the created constraint on the **Constraints** page.
