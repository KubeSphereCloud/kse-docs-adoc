This section introduces how to manage users.

The default administrator user **admin** in KubeSphere has all permissions on the KubeSphere platform and can create other users as needed. Users can be invited to join clusters and workspaces, and workspace members can be invited to join various projects. That is, a user can be a member under a cluster, workspace, or project.
