KubeSphere supports creating services and their backend workloads in the following ways:

* Create a stateful service: Create a service with the internal access mode set to Headless, and simultaneously create a StatefulSet as the backend workload for the service.

* Create a stateless service: Create a service with the internal access mode set to VirtualIP, and simultaneously create a Deployment as the backend workload for the service.

* Create an external service: The service forwards business traffic to other services outside the cluster.

// * Create a service from source code: Create a service with the internal access mode set to Headless or VirtualIP, and use Java, Node.js, or Python source code to create the backend workload for the service.

// * Create a service from artifacts: Create a service with the internal access mode set to Headless or VirtualIP, and use JAR, WAR, or binary artifact files to create the backend workload for the service.

* Specify a workload: Create a service with the internal access mode set to Headless or VirtualIP, and use an existing workload in the project as the backend workload for the service.
