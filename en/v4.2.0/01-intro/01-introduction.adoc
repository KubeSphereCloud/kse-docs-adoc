link:https://kubesphere.com.cn/kse/[KubeSphere] is a distributed, multi-tenant commercial cloud-native operating system built on Kubernetes. It extends open-source capabilities across key business scenarios including multi-cloud cluster management, microservices governance, application management, and observability. All functions are highly modularized to meet diverse business requirements. With a robust enterprise-grade cloud-native foundation, complemented by comprehensive expert-level solutions and service support, KubeSphere empowers enterprises in their digital transformation and large-scale operations.

Starting with KubeSphere v4.0, an extension mechanism was introduced, leading to the unveiling of a new architecture: **KubeSphere LuBan**. Built on top of link:https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/[Kubernetes], it supports high configurability and extensibility. Leveraging the cloud-native, extensible, and open architecture of KubeSphere LuBan, KubeSphere enables seamless integration of upstream and downstream applications, allows for the integration of various high-quality extensions from anywhere, and delivers harmonized business capabilities with a highly consistent user experience.

== New Features

KubeSphere v4.2 is a significant release packed with numerous core features, focusing on improvements and enhancements across four key areas, specifically covering the following aspects:

=== All-New UI Design and Product Experience Optimization

A redesigned interface simplifies operational paths and enhances interaction efficiency, helping users manage various resources more effectively.

* Optimized Page Framework: The top navigation bar now features global perspective switching, integrating platform-level management functions. The sidebar navigation bar is always visible, supporting quick resource switching and search for smoother operations.
* Quick Access Feature: Supports customizing access points for clusters, workspaces, and extensions, personalizing the interface to boost operational efficiency.
* Simplified Workload Creation Flow: Workspaces now include workload templates, reducing hierarchy levels and pre-setting parameters for faster and more convenient creation.
* Enhanced Extension Invocation: The workload details page integrates a unified extension invocation mechanism, allowing association of resources via pop-up operations while maintaining page continuity.
* Improved Debug Experience: Details pages now directly display and allow debugging of containers and pods, making troubleshooting more efficient.

=== Fully Pluggable Extensions

This version further optimizes the extension mechanism and enhances system architecture flexibility. By introducing more extension points, deeply decoupling functional modules, supporting on-demand component loading, providing flexible configuration mechanisms, and improving lifecycle management, it comprehensively addresses key issues such as high module coupling, inability to update independently, and long delivery cycles, significantly improving platform flexibility, maintainability, and continuous delivery capabilities.

Core Advantages:

* Agile Delivery, Rapid Response: Supports independent upgrading and release of functional modules, significantly shortening the cycle for new feature rollouts and issue fixes, thereby improving overall delivery efficiency.
* Flexible Architecture, On-Demand Extension: Offers rich extension points and component configuration options to meet diverse business needs and support continuous evolution of platform capabilities.
* Precisely Fits Business Scenarios: Modular design allows functions to be combined and tailored, helping enterprises quickly adapt to different application scenarios and usage habits.
* Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Simplifies operational processes, reduces platform management costs, and improves system stability and controllability.
