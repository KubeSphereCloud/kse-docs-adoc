Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes' built-in autoscaling pipelines.

Metrics Server collects resource metrics from Kubelets and exposes them in the Kubernetes apiserver through the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics[Metrics API], for use by the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler] and link:https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/[Vertical Pod Autoscaler].

Metrics Server enables the following features:

- CPU/Memory-based horizontal autoscaling (Learn more about link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/[Horizontal Autoscaling])
- Automatic adjustment/recommendation of resources required by containers (Learn more about link:https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/[Vertical Autoscaling])
