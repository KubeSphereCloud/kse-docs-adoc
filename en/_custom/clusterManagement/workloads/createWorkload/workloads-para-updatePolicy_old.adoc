|Parameter |Description

|Rolling Update (Recommended)
|Gradually replace old pod replicas with new ones. During the upgrade, traffic will be load-balanced between old and new pod replicas, ensuring no service interruption. If you choose this strategy, you need to further configure the **Maximum Unavailable Pods** and **Maximum Surge Pods**.

|Simultaneous Update
|Delete all old pod replicas before creating new ones. Service will be interrupted during the upgrade.
