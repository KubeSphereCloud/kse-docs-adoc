|Cluster
|A cluster is a larger computer service system composed of a group of independent computers or servers.

|Node
|A node is each working machine that makes up a cluster, which can be a virtual machine or a physical machine. Each node can operate and process tasks independently.

|Workspace
|A workspace is the basic logical unit for managing projects and organizing members, serving as the foundation of the KubeSphere multi-tenant system.

|Workspace Member
|A user invited to work in a workspace, possessing specific permissions.

|Project
|A project in KubeSphere corresponds to a namespace in Kubernetes.

|Multi-cluster Project
|A project where workloads are deployed across multiple clusters.

|Project Member
|A user invited to work in a project, possessing specific permissions.

|Console
|The user login page, which displays resources the tenant has access to, such as workspaces and projects.

|Pod
|A Pod is the smallest manageable unit of an application in Kubernetes, equivalent to the logical host of the application. Each Pod contains one or more containers that share resources such as network and storage. Each Pod is typically used to run a single instance of a given application.

|Container
|A container is a portable, executable, lightweight image used as an independent runtime environment to encapsulate an application and its dependencies.

|Image
|An image is a static template for a container, containing the application's code, runtime environment, and dependencies, used to create container instances.

|Docker
|An open-source application container engine for creating, deploying, and managing containers.

|Docker Hub
|A container image repository.

|KubeKey
|A brand-new installation tool offering flexible installation choices. It can install only Kubernetes or both Kubernetes and KubeSphere simultaneously. KubeKey also supports various installation options, such as All-in-One, multi-node installation, and offline installation. Users only need to prepare the configuration file and then execute the relevant commands.

// |ks-installer
// |An installation package for deploying KubeSphere on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

|kube-proxy
|kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster.

|Kubectl
|kubectl is the command-line tool for Kubernetes, used to communicate with the cluster's control plane. It supports cluster management, application deployment, resource status queries, and other operations.

|Workload
|A workload is an application running on KubeSphere, responsible for managing one or more Pods of an application.

|Deployment
|A type of workload used to manage stateless applications. A deployment runs several replicas of an application and automatically replaces instances that crash or fail. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment].

|StatefulSet
|A StatefulSet is a workload object used to manage stateful applications, such as MySQL. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet].

|DaemonSet
|A DaemonSet manages multiple Pod replicas, ensuring that Pod replicas run on a set of nodes in the cluster. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[DaemonSet].

|Job
|A Job is a deterministic or batch task that needs to run to completion, used to manage Pods that run only once or periodically. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Job].

|CronJob
|A CronJob is a batch task that needs to run at a specific time or repeatedly at specified intervals. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/[CronJob].

|Service
|Exposes an application running on Pods as a network service, providing a fixed address (domain name or IP address) for client access. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Service].

|NodePort
|Exposes a service using the IP address and a static port (NodePort) on each node. The service can be accessed via `<Node IP>:<NodePort>`.

|LoadBalancer
|Exposes a service externally using a load balancer provided by a cloud service provider.

|Ingress
|Ingress is used to aggregate services within the cluster and provide external access. Each Ingress contains mapping rules from a domain name and its subpaths to different services. KubeSphere Ingress corresponds to Kubernetes Ingress.
|===

== Storage

[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Term
|Description

|Volume
|A basic resource object used to provide storage to containers.

|Storage Class
|Defines the types of volumes available for containers to use.

|Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
|A Persistent Volume Claim is a user's declaration of storage requirements. It is a resource within a namespace, where specifications like storage size and access mode can be defined. The system binds or creates a Persistent Volume based on the PVC.

|Persistent Volume (PV)
|A storage area created in the backend storage system based on the parameters in the Persistent Volume Claim, available for containers to use. It is a general-purpose, pluggable, persistent resource not constrained by the lifecycle of a single Pod.

|Volume Snapshot Class
|Defines a class of volume snapshots that can save snapshot data.

|Volume Snapshot
|A complete copy or mirror of a volume's data at a specific point in time. Data can be fully restored to the snapshot point using a snapshot.

== DevOps

[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Term
|Description

|DevOps Project
|A DevOps project is used to create and manage pipelines, credentials, and CI/CD-related resources.

|SCM (Source Control Management)
|Source Control Management, such as GitHub and GitLab.

|In-SCM
|Building a pipeline based on a Jenkinsfile through an SCM tool.

|Out-of-SCM
|Building a pipeline through a graphical editing panel without writing a Jenkinsfile.

|CI Node
|A dedicated node for pipeline, S2I, and B2I tasks. Generally, applications often need to pull multiple dependencies during the build process, which can lead to issues like long pull times, network instability, and build failures. To ensure pipeline stability and speed up builds (via caching), you can configure one or a set of CI nodes dedicated for CI/CD pipelines and S2I/B2I tasks.

|B2I (Binary-to-Image)
|B2I is a set of tools and workflows for building reproducible container images from binary executables (e.g., Jar and War files). After developers and operations teams package projects into artifacts like War and Jar files, they can quickly package these artifacts or binary packages into Docker images and publish them to image repositories like DockerHub or Harbor.

|S2I (Source-to-Image)
|S2I is a set of tools and workflows for building reproducible container images from source code. By injecting source code into a container image, it automatically packages the compiled code into an image. In KubeSphere, S2I is supported for building images, and it also supports creating services to generate images from source code with one click, push them to a repository, and create their deployments and services, ultimately publishing them to Kubernetes automatically.
