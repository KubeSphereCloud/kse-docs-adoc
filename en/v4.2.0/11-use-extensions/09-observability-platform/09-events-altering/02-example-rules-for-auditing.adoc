== Alert Rule Parameter Description

Alert rules currently support three types: auditing, events, and logs. Configure different types of alert rules under `spec.type`, such as `type: auditing`, `type: events`, or `type: logs`.

The configuration items for alert rules `spec.rules` are as follows:
[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`name`
| Rule name.

|`desc`
| Rule description.

|`expr.kind`
|Rule type, which can be `rule`, `macro`, `list`, or `alias`.

|`expr.condition`
|The filter expression for logs to check if they match the rule. You can use comparison operators (=, !=, <, <=, >, >=, contains, in, like, regexp), boolean operators (and, or, and not), and parentheses for combination.

|`expr.macro`
| The condition for a macro.

|`expr.list`
| The value for a list.

|`expr.alias`
| The value for an alias.

|`enable`
| If false, the rule will not take effect.

|`alerts.output`
| Specifies the message output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations`
| Annotations for the rule, included in the alert message output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations.summary`
| Specifies the summary message output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations.summaryCn`
| Specifies the Chinese summary message output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.severity`
| The alert severity level for the rule, which can be INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL.
|===

**Macro**

A macro is a fragment of a rule condition that can be reused within rules or even other macros. Macros provide a way to name common patterns and eliminate redundancy in rules. The following is an example of a macro:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: macro-rule
spec:
  type: auditing
  rules:
  - desc: pod
    expr:
      kind: macro
      macro: ObjectRef.Resource="pods"
    name: pod
----

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
Macros can be used in rules or other macros, for example, `${pod}` or `${alerting-rule.pod}`. The difference between these two methods is that `${pod}` can only be used within `alerting-rule`, while `${alerting-rule.pod}` can be used across all instances. Macros can also be used in lists and aliases.
|===

**List**

A list is a collection of items that can be included in rules, macros, or other lists. Unlike rules and macros, a list cannot be parsed as a filter expression. The following is an example of a list:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: list-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: all action not need to be audit
    expr:
      kind: list
      list:
        - get
        - list
        - watch
    name: ignore-action
----

**Alias**

An alias is an abbreviated name for a filter field, which can be included in rules, macros, lists, and output strings. The following is an example of an alias:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: alias-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: the alias of the user related to audit event
    expr:
      alias: User.username
      kind: alias
    name: user
