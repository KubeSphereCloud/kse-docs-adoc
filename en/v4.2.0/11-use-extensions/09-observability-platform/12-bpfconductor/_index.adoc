This section introduces how to use the "WizTelemetry Network Observability" extension.

This extension is used to deploy and manage eBPF monitoring agents in a Kubernetes cluster. It comes with multiple eBPF programs/plugins related to network observability, providing deep insights into Layer 4 network traffic, Layer 7 HTTP traffic, and network topology.

After installing the "WizTelemetry Network Observability" extension, the **Network** menu will appear in the WizTelemetry Observability Platform within the Component Dock. You can use network observability-related features, including: Network Topology, Service Topology, and HTTP Traffic.

|Note

|WizTelemetry Network Observability depends on the WizTelemetry Platform Service, WizTelemetry Monitoring, and WizTelemetry Data Pipeline. Therefore, you must install and configure the dependent extensions before installing WizTelemetry Network Observability. Otherwise, the network observability features will not function properly!

== System Requirements

=== Kernel Version Requirements

* Recommended: Linux kernel version 5.8+ for full eBPF feature support
* Minimum: Linux kernel version 4.18+

=== Kernel Feature Support

* Ensure eBPF support is enabled in the kernel (CONFIG_BPF=y)
* For older kernels (4.x), it is strongly recommended to use a custom kernel with backported eBPF features
** Some distributions (e.g., CentOS, RHEL) may have backported eBPF features to older kernels
** Please consult your distribution's documentation to confirm eBPF feature support

=== Node Resource Requirements

* Ensure nodes have sufficient resources (CPU, memory) to run the BPF agent
* Reserve appropriate system resources for BPF programs in production environments
