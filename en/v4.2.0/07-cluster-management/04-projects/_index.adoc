This section introduces how to manage projects.

On the KubeSphere platform, projects are used to group and manage resources. You can create resources in a project, invite users to join the project, and set different access permissions for different users. There are two types of projects on the KubeSphere platform:

* User Project: A project created by users for managing user resources.

* System Project: A project automatically created by the KubeSphere system for managing KubeSphere system resources. Generally, it is not recommended to create user resources in system projects.
