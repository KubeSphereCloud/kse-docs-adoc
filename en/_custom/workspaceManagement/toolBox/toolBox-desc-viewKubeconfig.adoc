This section describes how to view and download the kubeconfig file.

The kubeconfig file contains the cluster's authentication information and is used to grant access to the cluster for other applications. KubeSphere supports automatically generating a kubeconfig file based on the currently logged-in user, which can grant the same access permissions as the current user to other applications. For more information, please refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes official documentation].
