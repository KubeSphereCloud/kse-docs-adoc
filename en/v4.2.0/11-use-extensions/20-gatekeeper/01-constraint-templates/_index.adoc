Constraint Templates are templates used to define and manage constraints for validating certain sets of Kubernetes objects within Gatekeeper's Kubernetes admission controller.

Constraint templates can be applied to clusters to create actual constraint instances. For more information about constraint templates, please refer to link:https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/#constraint-templates[ConstraintTemplates].
