|Capabilities
|
Additional permissions added to or removed from container processes in the Linux system. Refer to the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html[Linux official documentation] for a list of Linux process capabilities.

* When adding or removing capabilities for container processes, you need to remove the **CAP_** prefix from the capability name. For example, entering **SYS_TIME** in the **Remove** text box removes the **CAP_SYS_TIME** capability from the container process.

* Click **Add** to set multiple capability addition or removal instructions.
