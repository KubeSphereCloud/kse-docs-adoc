In a multi-cluster system, the user who adds a cluster automatically becomes the cluster administrator. Additionally, the **admin** user of the KubeSphere platform has all permissions in all clusters by default. In the initial state of a cluster, the aforementioned users can invite other users to join the cluster and assign roles to users within the cluster.
