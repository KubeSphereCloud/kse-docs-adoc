|Parameter |Description

include::../../../../_custom/projectManagement/services/services-para-artifactFile.adoc[]

include::../../../../_custom/projectManagement/services/services-para-buildEnvironmentArtifact.adoc[]

|Image Name
|The name of the target container image to be built. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), slashes (/), and colons (:), and must start and end with a lowercase letter or number.

The image name should include the image's namespace, for example, **my-namespace/my-image**. If no namespace is entered, the system will automatically add the namespace **library**, and the actual image name will be **library/my-image**.

|Image Tag
|The tag of the target container image to be built.

|Target Image Service
|The image service used to store the target image. Please select a Secret containing the image service information.

|Trigger Token
|The authentication token used by the client to trigger KubeSphere image builds via webhook. If a token is set, requests must provide the correct token to trigger the image build. The token can only contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.

After the service is created, KubeSphere will create the image builder and provide a URL that can be used by third-party applications to trigger image builds. You can obtain the URL on the details page of the image builder.
