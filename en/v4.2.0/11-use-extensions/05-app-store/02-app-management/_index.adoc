In the KubeSphere platform, an application specifically refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. The application template feature of the KubeSphere platform is implemented based on Helm at its core, using Helm Charts to define the orchestration method of applications.

You can create an application template in a workspace that contains one or more application versions (each application version is defined by a Helm Chart), thereby installing the applications defined in the application template within the projects of the workspace.
