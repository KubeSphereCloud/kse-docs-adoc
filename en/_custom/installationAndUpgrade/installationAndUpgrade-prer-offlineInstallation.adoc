* If your cluster nodes cannot connect to the internet, you also need to prepare a Linux server to create a private image service. This server must be network-accessible to the KubeSphere cluster nodes and have at least 100 GB of disk space mounted at the **/mnt/registry** directory.

// In addition, you need to create the offline installation package **kubekey-artifact.tar.gz** in advance and transfer it to the cluster node used to perform the operations in this section.
