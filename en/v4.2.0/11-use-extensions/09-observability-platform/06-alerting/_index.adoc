This section introduces how to use the "WizTelemetry Alerting" extension.

WizTelemetry Alerting is based on monitoring data collected by KubeSphere. It provides alerting and alert rule management functions from the platform, cluster, and project perspectives for different resource types and monitoring metrics.

After installing the "WizTelemetry Alerting" extension, the **Alerting** and **Rule Groups** options will appear under the **Monitoring & Alerting** menu in the left navigation pane of the cluster and workspace.

|
- WizTelemetry Alerting depends on the WizTelemetry Platform Service and WizTelemetry Monitoring. Therefore, you must install these two extensions before installing WizTelemetry Alerting. Otherwise, the alerting-related functions will not work properly!

- To receive system alert messages promptly, it is recommended to also install the WizTelemetry Notification extension.
