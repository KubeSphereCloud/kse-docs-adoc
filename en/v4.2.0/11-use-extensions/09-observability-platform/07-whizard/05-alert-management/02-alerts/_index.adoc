This section describes how to view alerts generated by global alerting rule groups.

The **Built-in Alerts** and **Custom Alerts** pages under **Global Alerting** display global alerts generated by the system based on global **Built-in Rule Groups** and global **Custom Rule Groups**. When the metrics set in a global alerting rule group meet the preset conditions and duration, the system will generate an alert. When the metrics no longer meet the preset conditions, the alert will be automatically cleared by the system.
