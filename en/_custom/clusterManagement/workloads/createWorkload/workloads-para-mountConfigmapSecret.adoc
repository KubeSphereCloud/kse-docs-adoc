|Parameter |Description

|Select ConfigMap/Select Secret
|Select a ConfigMap or Secret from the current project.

|Mount Mode
|Set how the data from the ConfigMap or Secret is mounted on the container. ConfigMaps and Secrets only support mounting as **Read-Only** or **Do Not Mount**.

|Mount Path
|Set the path on the container where the data from the ConfigMap or Secret is mounted.

* The system will generate a folder based on the data in the ConfigMap or Secret, mapping each key-value pair to a file, where the key is the filename and the value is the file content.

* Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/textfield.svg[textfield,18,18] to specify key-value pairs from the ConfigMap or Secret to be mounted as files. If no subpath is specified, the entire ConfigMap or Secret is mounted by default. If a subpath is used, the files mounted into the container will not be dynamically updated with changes to the ConfigMap or Secret.

|Select Specific Key
|Mount key-value pairs from the ConfigMap or Secret as files into the container. Files mounted into the container will be dynamically updated with changes to the ConfigMap or Secret. Click **Add** to mount multiple key-value pairs.

* **Key**: The key name of the key-value pair in the ConfigMap or Secret that needs to be mounted.

* **Path**: The path within the container relative to the **Mount Path**. The specified key-value pair from the ConfigMap or Secret will be mounted at this path, overwriting any existing files at the **Mount Path**.
