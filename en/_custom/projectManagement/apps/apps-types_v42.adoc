In the KubeSphere platform, an application specifically refers to a business program composed of one or more workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources. Based on the creation method, applications on the KubeSphere platform are categorized into the following two types:

*   Template-based applications: Applications created using existing application templates. The application templates used for creation can be templates uploaded to a workspace, templates published to the App Store, or templates from third-party application repositories.

*   Composed apps: Applications created by users manually orchestrating workloads, services, Ingresses, and other resources.
