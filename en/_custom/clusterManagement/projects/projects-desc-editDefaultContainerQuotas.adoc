This section describes how to edit the default container quota.

The default container quota is the default value for resource reservations and resource limits for containers in a project. When creating a container in a project, if the user does not specify resource reservations and resource limits, the KubeSphere system will automatically use the default container quota.

The default container quota includes two types of settings:

* Resource Reservation: The resources reserved by the system for the container.

* Resource Limit: The upper limit of resources that the container can use.
