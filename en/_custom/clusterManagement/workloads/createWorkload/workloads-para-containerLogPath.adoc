|Container Log Path
|The path where container logs are located when the **Collect Logs on Volumes** feature is enabled.

* This path is relative to the volume's mount path. Wildcards are supported, and multiple paths can be separated by commas (,). For example, when the volume mount path is **/data**, **log/*.log** indicates that the log files are all .log format files in the **/data/log** directory.

* To use the **Collect Logs on Volumes** feature, you need to configure the application in the container to export logs to the path set here.
