The WizTelemetry Platform Service is the common service for all extensions within the WizTelemetry Observability Platform. It serves as a common APIServer for all observability extensions, providing shared backend platform services.

// After installing the WizTelemetry Platform Service, **WizTelemetry Observability Platform** will appear in the **Component Dock**.

**Configuration Notes:**

* Modifying the configuration of the WizTelemetry Platform Service extension can work in conjunction with the WizTelemetry Global Monitoring extension to enable global monitoring and global alerting features.
