DevOps supports deploying and managing CI/CD tasks and related workloads on Kubernetes clusters. When installing the DevOps extension, Jenkins is automatically deployed, supporting pipeline builds via Jenkinsfile. Additionally, DevOps provides a graphical editing panel that visualizes the entire workflow, intuitively presenting the operational status of the pipeline at each stage.

After installing the DevOps extension, **DevOps** will be displayed in the workspace's left navigation pane.

This section describes how to manage DevOps projects within a workspace, as well as how to perform management and operations within DevOps projects, including running pipelines, creating credentials, and integrating tools.
