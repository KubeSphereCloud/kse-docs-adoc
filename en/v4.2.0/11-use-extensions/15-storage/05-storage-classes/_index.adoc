This section introduces how to set authorization rules and auto-scaling for storage classes.

After installing the "KubeSphere Storage" extension, the **Storage Classes** in the cluster will support **Set Authorization Rules** and **Set Auto-scaling**.

* **Set Authorization Rules**: Users can only use the storage class in specific projects and workspaces.
* **Set Auto-scaling**: The system automatically expands the volume capacity when the remaining space of the volume falls below a threshold.
