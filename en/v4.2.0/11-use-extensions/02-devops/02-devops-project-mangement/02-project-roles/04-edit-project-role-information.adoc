This section describes how to edit project role information.

You can edit the alias and description of project roles created by users. KubeSphere does not support editing built-in project roles, nor does it support editing the name of a project role.


== Prerequisites


include::../../../../../_custom/devops/projectManagement-prer-requiredPermission.adoc[]



== Steps

include::../../../../../_custom/workspaceManagement/workspaceManagement-oper-openWorkspacePage.adoc[]

include::../../../../../../_ks_components/oper-navigate.adoc[]

+

include::../../../../../_custom/devops/projectRoles/roles-oper-openListPage.adoc[]

+

include::../../../../../_custom/projectManagement/projects-oper-dropdownList.adoc[]

+

. To the right of the project role you want to operate, click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg[more,18,18], and then select **Edit Information** from the dropdown list.

. In the **Edit Information** dialog box, set the alias and description for the project role, and then click **OK**.
