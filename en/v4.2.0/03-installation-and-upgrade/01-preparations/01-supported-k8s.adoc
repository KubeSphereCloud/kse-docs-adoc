This section introduces the environment requirements for KubeSphere.

== System Requirements

[%header,cols="3a,4a,4a"]
|===

== Storage Requirements

* A default storage class must be available in the cluster.
+
--
A storage class defines a type of storage volume available for containers. If you do not set up an external persistent storage system when installing KubeSphere, KubeSphere will use the local storage system of the cluster nodes as the persistent storage system and automatically create a corresponding **local** storage class. If you use an external persistent storage system, you need to install a storage plugin for the KubeSphere cluster and create a storage class to define the types of storage volumes available for use. For how to install a storage plugin, contact your storage system provider or refer to link:../04-configure-external-persistent-storage[Configure External Persistent Storage].
--

* The various components of KubeSphere only require the storage system to provide the ability to create and delete Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), and do not rely on advanced capabilities such as expansion, cloning, or snapshots.

== Dependency Requirements

== Container Runtime Requirements

[%header,cols="4a,4a"]
|===
|Supported Container Runtime |Version

|Docker
|20.10.0+

|containerd
|Latest version

|CRI-O (Experimental, not fully tested)
|Latest version

|iSula (Experimental, not fully tested)
|Latest version
|===

== Network Requirements

* Ensure the DNS addresses in **/etc/resolv.conf** are available; otherwise, DNS issues may occur in the cluster.

* If your network configuration uses firewall rules or security groups, ensure infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. It is recommended to disable the firewall.

* Supported CNI plugins: Calico and Flannel. Other plugins are also applicable (e.g., Cilium and Kube-OVN, etc.), but note they are not fully tested.

== Port Requirements

Certain ports are required for communication between services. If your network configuration has firewall rules, you need to ensure infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. These ports serve as communication endpoints for certain processes or services.

== Extension Support Matrix

KubeSphere v4.2.0 natively supports Kubernetes v1.23~1.32. This section details the supported Kubernetes versions for each KubeSphere extension. To avoid compatibility issues during use, please use supported Kubernetes versions.
