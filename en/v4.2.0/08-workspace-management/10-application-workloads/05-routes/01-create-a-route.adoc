* To create an Ingress that supports the HTTPS protocol, you need to create a **TLS Information** type Secret. The Secret must contain the Base64-encoded certificate and private key. For more information, please refer to link:../../../12-configuration/01-secrets/01-create-a-secret/[Create a Secret].

* There is at least one Service in the project to which the Ingress belongs. For more information, please refer to link:../../02-services/01-create-a-service/01-create-a-stateful-or-stateless-service/[Create a Service].
