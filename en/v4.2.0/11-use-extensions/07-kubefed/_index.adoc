This section describes how to use the "Federated Cluster Application Management" extension to manage federated projects, and how to manage application workloads, persistent volume claims, configuration resources, and project settings within federated projects.

A federated project is a project created based on multiple clusters. Resources within a federated project can run on different clusters.

Federated Cluster Application Management is an extension designed to simplify the management of applications across multiple federated Kubernetes clusters. You can easily deploy, update, and manage applications across multiple federated clusters, while providing flexible configuration options to meet different needs.

After installing the "Federated Cluster Application Management" extension, the **Federated Projects** menu will appear in the left navigation pane of the workspace, and the **Federated Projects** entry will also be displayed in the Component Dock.
