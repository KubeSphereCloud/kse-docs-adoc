This section introduces how to use the "WizTelemetry Events Alerting" extension.

WizTelemetry Events Alerting supports auditing alerts, event alerts, and log alerting features. It allows you to define alerting rules for Kubernetes/KubeSphere auditing events, Kubernetes native events, and container logs. It evaluates incoming event and log data and sends alerts to specified receivers, such as alertmanager.

Among these, log alerting supports keyword-triggered alerts and sliding window-triggered alerts.

- Keyword-based alerts: Trigger an alert when specific keywords appear in the logs.

- Sliding window alerts: Trigger an alert when the volume of log data meeting specified conditions reaches a user-defined threshold within a sliding time window.
