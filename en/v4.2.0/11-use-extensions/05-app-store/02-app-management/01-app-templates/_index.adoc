This section introduces how to manage application templates in a workspace.

Each application template can contain one or more application versions defined by Helm Charts. You can upload Helm Charts as application templates to a workspace, enabling the installation of applications from these templates in all projects within that workspace. You can further upload application templates to the App Store, making them available for application installation in all projects across the KubeSphere platform.
