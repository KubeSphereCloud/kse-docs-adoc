Grafana Alloy is a flexible, high-performance, vendor-neutral distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector. Alloy uniquely combines the best open-source observability signals from the community. Alloy provides native pipelines for OTel, Prometheus, Pyroscope, Loki, and many other metrics, logs, traces, and profiling tools. Additionally, you can use Alloy pipelines to perform different tasks, such as configuring alerting rules in Loki and Mimir. Alloy is fully compatible with OTel Collector, Prometheus Agent, and Promtail. You can use Alloy as a replacement for these solutions or combine them into a hybrid system containing multiple collectors and agents. You can deploy Alloy anywhere in your IT infrastructure and pair it with the Grafana LGTM technology stack, Grafana Cloud's telemetry backend, or any other vendor's compatible backend. Alloy is flexible, allowing you to easily configure it to meet the needs of on-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployments. For more information, see link:https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/[Alloy official documentation].

Grafana Alloy for WizTelemetry can be used to collect Kubernetes logs, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry data, and can also be used as an Exporter for various metrics.
