Grafana Tempo for WizTelemetry is an open-source, easy-to-use, and highly scalable distributed tracing backend. Tempo is cost-effective, requiring only object storage to run, and is deeply integrated with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki. You can use Tempo with open-source tracing protocols including Jaeger, Zipkin, or OpenTelemetry.

You can send trace data from "WizTelemetry Tracing" to Grafana Tempo for WizTelemetry to visualize this data through the Grafana console.
