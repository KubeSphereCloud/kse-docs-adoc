This section introduces how to use the 'WizTelemetry Events' extension.

This extension can persistently store events from resources such as workloads, Jobs, pods, Services, Ingresses, etc., and provides multi-tenant event search and viewing capabilities.

After installing the 'WizTelemetry Events' extension,

* The WizTelemetry Observability Platform in the Component Dock will display a **Logging** menu, and under the **Logging** menu, an **Event Query** option will appear.

* The cluster's left navigation pane will display a **Logging** menu, and under the **Logging** menu, **Log Receivers** and **Event Query** options will appear. The **Log Receivers** page will display a **Resource Events** tab, supporting the addition of various types of log receivers. For more information, please refer to link:../02-logging/02-log-receivers/[Log Receivers]. The **Event Query** page allows users to query resource events within their permission scope.

| Note

|
WizTelemetry Events depends on the WizTelemetry Platform Service and the WizTelemetry Data Pipeline. Therefore, before installing WizTelemetry Events, you must first install and configure these two extensions. Otherwise, the event-related features will not function properly!
