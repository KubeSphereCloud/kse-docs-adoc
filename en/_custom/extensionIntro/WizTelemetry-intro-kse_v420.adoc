**WizTelemetry Platform Service**: The common service for all extensions of the WizTelemetry Observability Platform. It serves as a common APIServer for all observability extensions, providing shared backend platform services.

**WizTelemetry Data Pipeline**: Provides capabilities for collecting, transforming, and routing observability data.

**OpenSearch Distributed Search and Analytics Engine**: The default log receiver used by KubeSphere for storing observability data such as logs, audits, events, and notification history.

**WizTelemetry Logging**: Provides real-time and historical log collection, query, export, and storage for cloud-native applications from a multi-tenant perspective. It can connect to log receivers such as ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, and Kafka.

**WizTelemetry Events**: Enables long-term storage of events generated by Kubernetes-related objects and provides event search and viewing capabilities from a multi-tenant perspective.

**WizTelemetry Auditing**: Records user-related operational behaviors on the KubeSphere platform in real-time and provides search and viewing of audit history from a multi-tenant perspective, allowing for quick traceback of user actions.

**WizTelemetry Monitoring**: Provides cloud-native resource monitoring capabilities from a multi-tenant perspective, displaying real-time and historical data for core monitoring metrics of objects such as clusters, nodes, workloads, GPUs, and the Kubernetes control plane.

**WizTelemetry Alerting**: Based on monitoring data collected by KubeSphere, it provides alerting and alert rule management from both platform and tenant perspectives for different resource types and monitoring metrics.

**WizTelemetry Global Monitoring**: An extension within the WizTelemetry Observability Platform that provides cross-cluster resource monitoring and multi-cluster alerting, incorporating the functionalities of the original Whizard Observability Center.

**WizTelemetry Events Alerting**: Defines alert rules for Kubernetes/KubeSphere audit events, Kubernetes native events, and container logs. It evaluates incoming event and log data and sends alerts to specified receivers, such as alertmanager.

**WizTelemetry Notification**: Manages notifications in multi-tenant Kubernetes environments. It can receive alerts, cloud events, and other types of events (e.g., audit and Kubernetes events) from different senders and route notifications to the appropriate tenants based on tenant labels (such as namespace or user).

**WizTelemetry Network Observability**: Used for deploying and managing eBPF monitoring agents in Kubernetes clusters. It includes multiple eBPF programs/plugins related to network observability, providing deep insights into Layer 4 network traffic, Layer 7 HTTP traffic, and network topology.

**WizTelemetry Tracing**: Provides distributed tracing functionality based on link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/[OpenTelemetry].

**Grafana for WizTelemetry**: An open and composable data visualization and monitoring analysis platform. It includes numerous built-in dashboards to enhance the visualization capabilities of the WizTelemetry Observability Platform.

**Grafana Loki for WizTelemetry**: Stores KubeSphere logs, audits, events, and notification history data, and supports viewing them in the Grafana console.

**Grafana Alloy for WizTelemetry**: A distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector. In addition to collecting Kubernetes logs, Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry data, it can also be used as an exporter for various metrics.

**Grafana Tempo for WizTelemetry**: An open-source, easy-to-use, and highly scalable distributed tracing backend. Tempo is cost-effective, requiring only object storage to run, and is deeply integrated with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki. You can use Tempo with open-source tracing protocols, including Jaeger, Zipkin, or OpenTelemetry.
