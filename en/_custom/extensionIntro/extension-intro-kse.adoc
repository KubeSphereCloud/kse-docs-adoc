.12+|WizTelemetry Observability Platform
|WizTelemetry Platform Service
|It is the common service for each extension of the WizTelemetry Observability Platform. It is a common APIServer for all observability extensions, providing common backend platform services for all observability extensions.

|WizTelemetry Data Pipeline
|Provides capabilities for collecting, transforming, and routing observability data.

|OpenSearch Distributed Search and Analytics Engine
|A built-in log storage extension for KubeSphere, used to store observability data such as logs, audits, events, and notification history.

|WizTelemetry Logging
|Provides real-time and historical log collection, query, export, and storage for cloud-native applications from a multi-tenant perspective. It can connect to log receivers such as ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, and Kafka.

|WizTelemetry Events
|Can persistently store events generated by Kubernetes-related objects and provides event search and viewing functions from a multi-tenant perspective.

|WizTelemetry Auditing
|Records user-related operational behaviors on the KubeSphere platform in real-time and provides search and viewing functions for audit history from a multi-tenant perspective, enabling quick tracing of related user operations.

|WizTelemetry Monitoring
|Provides cloud-native resource monitoring capabilities from a multi-tenant perspective, including real-time and historical data display of core monitoring metrics for objects such as clusters, nodes, workloads, GPUs, and the K8s control plane. It includes the Wiz Observability Center.

|WizTelemetry Alerting
|Based on monitoring data collected by KubeSphere, it provides alerting and alert rule management functions from platform and tenant perspectives for different resource types and monitoring metrics.

|WizTelemetry Events Alerting
|Defines alert rules for Kubernetes/KubeSphere audit events, Kubernetes native events, and Kubernetes logs, evaluates incoming event and log data, and sends alerts to specified receivers such as HTTP endpoints.

|WizTelemetry Notification
|Manages notifications in multi-tenant Kubernetes environments. It can receive alerts, cloud events, and other types of events (such as audit and Kubernetes events) from different senders and send notifications to corresponding tenant receivers based on tenant labels (such as namespace or user).

|Grafana for WizTelemetry
|An open and composable data visualization and monitoring analysis platform with numerous built-in dashboards to enhance the visualization capabilities of the WizTelemetry Observability Platform.

|Grafana Loki for WizTelemetry
|Supports viewing KubeSphere logs, audits, events, and notification history data stored in Loki from the Grafana console.

.7+|Platform Management
|KubeSphere App Store Management
|A multi-cloud application management platform based on OpenPitrix, used to upload, review, and manage different types of applications in multi-cloud environments. It can serve as a sharing and distribution management tool for data, middleware, and office applications among different teams within an enterprise.

|KubeSphere Service Mesh
|A powerful microservices governance and microservices visual management tool. It provides three grayscale release strategies including blue-green deployment, canary release, and traffic mirroring, along with two observability capabilities: traffic monitoring and link tracing.

|KubeSphere Multi-Cluster Proxy Connection
|It is a tool for establishing network connections between clusters through a proxy. If the host cluster cannot directly access member clusters, you can expose the proxy service address of the host cluster, allowing member clusters to connect to the host cluster through the proxy.

|Federated Cluster Application Management
|An extension designed to simplify application management across multiple federated Kubernetes clusters. Users can easily deploy, update, and manage applications across multiple federated clusters.

|KubeEdge Edge Computing Framework
|Adds edge nodes to the cluster and runs workloads on these nodes to extend native containerized application orchestration and management to edge devices.

|Metrics Server
|Dynamically scales the number of pods based on set metrics, enabling services running on them to have a certain adaptive capability to metric changes.

|Spring Cloud
|Provides microservices, microservice configuration, and microservice gateway functions.

|Database & Middleware
|RadonDB DMP
|An enterprise-grade cloud-native database management platform for Kubernetes multi-cloud scenarios. It easily enables cross-cloud deployment, multi-cloud management, intelligent observability, and unified operations for multiple types of mainstream databases. It fully builds an ecosystem loop around scenarios such as high performance, high availability, business tracking, and data flow, helping customers truly achieve Database as a Service.

|CI/CD
|DevOps
|Provides out-of-the-box CI/CD functionality based on Jenkins, offering a one-stop DevOps solution and supporting pipeline creation using a graphical editing panel or Jenkinsfile.

.3+|Networking
|KubeSphere Gateway
|The KubeSphere Gateway is an extension that aggregates services and manages external access to the KubeSphere platform. It has now formed a gateway system with three resource management dimensions: "cluster, project, workspace," supporting the management of cluster gateways, workspace gateways, and project gateways.

|KubeSphere Networking
|Manages cluster network policies and pod IP pools. Controls the access and accessibility permissions of pods in clusters and projects; creates pod IP pools and allocates IP addresses from the pool to pods.

|Ingress Tool
|Provides multiple practical extension capabilities for Ingress, such as domain name reuse validation. After enabling, tenants cannot apply the same domain name to different projects when creating an Ingress.

.3+|Security
|Gatekeeper
|Gatekeeper is an admission controller for Kubernetes that enables flexible policy configuration. It uses link:https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent (OPA)] to validate requests for creating and updating resources on a Kubernetes cluster.

|OAuth2-Proxy
|Provides a unified authentication interface to ensure all applications are protected through the same process, simplifying identity authentication management in multi-application environments, improving security and user experience. Suitable for enterprise environments that require unified authentication management for multiple backend applications, and applications that need user authentication through third-party authentication services.

|Certificate Management
|Creates TLS certificates for workloads in Kubernetes and renews them before they expire.

|Storage
|KubeSphere Storage
|Manages volume snapshots, volume snapshot classes, sets authorization rules for storage classes, and configures automatic volume expansion.

|Artificial Intelligence
|NVIDIA GPU Operator
|An extension modified based on link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator[GPU Operator], supporting the creation, configuration, and management of GPUs on Kubernetes.
