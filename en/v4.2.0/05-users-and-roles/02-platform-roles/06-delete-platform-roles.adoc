This section describes how to delete platform roles.

You can delete platform roles created by users. Pre-configured platform roles cannot be deleted.


== Prerequisites

* You need to have the pass:a,q[{ks_permission}] permission on the KubeSphere platform. For more information, refer to link:../../01-users/[Users] and link:../../02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

* If the platform role you want to delete has already been assigned to users, you need to delete the users or modify their roles.
