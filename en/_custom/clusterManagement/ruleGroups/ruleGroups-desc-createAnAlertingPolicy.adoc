This section describes how to create alert rule groups.

KubeSphere's monitoring and alerting functionality is built on Prometheus. Each rule group can contain multiple alert rules. You can create alert rules using the system-provided rule templates or by manually entering PromQL expressions. For more information, please refer to the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Prometheus official documentation].
