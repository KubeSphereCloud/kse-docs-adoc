This section describes how to create, edit, enable, disable, and view global alerting rule groups in WizTelemetry Global Monitoring.

You can create global alerting rule groups on the Rule Groups page of Global Alerting. Unlike rule groups created by users at the cluster and project levels, global rules can be used to monitor resources across all clusters managed by the platform. The **Built-in Rule Groups** page under **Global Alerting** provides pre-configured rule groups, and the **Custom Rule Groups** page supports creating your own rule groups. Rule groups cause the system to generate alerts when specific monitoring metrics meet preset conditions and durations.
